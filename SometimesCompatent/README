HARTREE FOCK: S-WAVE MINNESOTA POTENTIAL
=====================================================================
from this directory: 

! to compile : 
make

! to run: 

./run_HF 2 4 10 
	 
arguments:  (A , n , hw ) 
	 A - number of particles
	 n - 2*n = Nshell_max
	 hw - trap frequency

Source files: ME_minn.f90 , Hartree_Fock.f90 , main.f90  

This code will calculate the matrix elements if they are not there. 
If they are there, it will skip that and just run HF. 
 	 
NOTE: For some reason Fernando's computer does not like to run HF after
 computing the matrix elements. If yours also does not like to do this, 
just run the executable a second time, and hopefully it will cooperate.

USING GAUSS-LEGENDRE QUADRATURE WITH 800 POINTS 

compile: gfortran -o run_hyd CoulombOscRelMe.f90 -L/user/local/lib/ -llapack -lblas 

run ./run_hyd


output is in: Hyd_energy.dat

rows correspond to different omega values, given in column 1. 
column 2 is nmax = 0
column 3 is nmax = 5
column 4 is nmax = 10 
and so on until nmax = 50
