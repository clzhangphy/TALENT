The HObasis.cpp code is a program that creates 3D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator 
(3DQHO) Wave Functions, and solves the Schroedinger Equation with a Coulomb
potential using these as basis functions.  To compile, use the following command
in the terminal:

g++ HObasis.cpp -o HObasis.exe -larmadillo

or any compiler of your choice. Just make sure to link armadillo.  The code is
pretty constantly being modified to print different things through the various
output files, but most recently the "Nerror.dat" file prints two columns of
data.  This can be used to make a ground state energy vs. "nu" plot, where nu
is defined as nu = 0.5*mu*omega/h_bar.  I used the wikipedia entry

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator#Example:_3D_isotropic_harmonic_oscillator

to contruct my 3DQHO wave functions, and thus used the nu parameter as they did.
To create the plot that I have included, I ran the code modifying the variable
cleverly named "N" which is the dimension of the Hamiltonian.  By plotting
several of these data files, which I will include, we can see how the energy 
converges with varying nu and varying N.

Things to still work on:
Using fancy quadrature integration rather than my simple Simpson method. 
However, I might skip this, as we need to start working on the next project.
