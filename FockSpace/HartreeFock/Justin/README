This folder will be used for the Hartree-Fock project.  The main program at the
momemnt is HF.cpp. This program can be compiled with

g++ -o HF.exe HF.cpp -larmadillo -std=c++11

and ran with

./HF.exe spBaby.dat mtxBaby.dat

where 'spBaby.dat' and 'mtxBaby.dat' are input files that contain some play
single-particle states and some play mtx elements.  In this example, I am using
a simple 2 level scheme with each level supporting spin up and spin down, and
the mtx elements are only connecting states with a pairing force. This example
comes from Morten's nuclear structure course.
