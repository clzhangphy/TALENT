This folder will be used for the Hartree-Fock project.  The main program at the
momemnt is HF.cpp. This program can be compiled with

g++ -o HF.exe HF.cpp -larmadillo -std=c++11

and ran with

./HF.exe spFile.dat mtxFile.dat

where 'spFile.dat' and 'mtxFile.dat' are input files that contain some play
single-particle states and some play mtx elements.  The executables spSetup.exe
and mtxSetup.exe create these files.  So the set up of the single particle
labeling scheme, and the creation of the matrix elements are actually done in
a different program, just creating the files.  Then HF.exe reads in these files
and gets to work.  At the moment, I think everything finally works.  With the
test example for two neutrons in a harmonic oscillator well interacting via the
Minnesota potential, the final energy of 25.139312 MeV was achieved with my
code.  To get this recent, m*c^2 = 938.9059 Mev, h_bar*c = 197.32891 Mev*fm,
and h_bar*Omega = 10 MeV were used.  Also, the single particle space for the
particles used are the n=0,1,2,3,4 oscillator shells with spin up & down allowed
in each of these shells, for a total of 10 single particle states for the basis.
A gauss_legendre intergrating scheme is used that was pulled from online from
Pawel Holodorobko. A final to do for this would would be to either include a 
tangent remap for the legendre integrating scheme, or to perhaps use laguerre.

mtxSetup.cpp is compiled with:

g++ -o mtxSetup.exe gauss_legendre.o mtxSetup.cpp

and spSetup.cpp is compiled with:

g++ -o spSetup.exe spSetup.cpp
