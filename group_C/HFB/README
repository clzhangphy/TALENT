Hartree-Fock-Bogoljubov program for neutron drops with Minnesota potential in spherical symmetry.
Potential is calculated in a brute-force way using multipolar decomposition
of the potential and a two-dimensional integration (both with 128 point Gauss-Laguerre).

exp(-mu(vec{r1}-vec{r2})^2)  = exp(-mu(r1-r2)^2) * 4pi
        * sum_LM iL(2*mu*r1*r2)/exp(2*mu*r1*r2) * Y*_LM(1) * Y_LM(2)
where iL(x)/exp(x) is (scaled) modified spherical Bessel function, calculated by GSL

Program is still not working properly for open-shell drops. Newton method is almost
unusable at the beginning, so the program is taking small steps in the vicinity of
changing N, but still the result doesn't converge (by the way: pairing is energetically
favorable only for small hw).


Usage: ./run hw Nmax lmax n_part
   or: ./run -i Vme_aaa.dat n_part

- the first command also saves the V matrix elements in a binary file,
which can be reused as shown in the second command

Nmax gives the maximal N = 2n+l (to calculate the basis size)
lmax gives the maximal l
n_part gives the number of particles

Example of input and output:

./run 10 10 1 10      (i.e. hw=10, Nmax=10, lmax=1, n_part=10)
