This program calculates the ground state of the hydrogen atom by 
expanding in the l=0 harmonic oscillator wavefunctions. 

hydrogen.cpp
	This is the main body of the program.  
harmonic_oscillator.cpp
	get HO wavefunction from this routine
gauss_legendre.c
	Program used to integrate, ripped from the interenet
functions.cpp
	This program contains my integrands for wavefunction and TBME

My program depends on armadillo/lapack/blas gsl libraries.  Also, the header file
gnuplot_i.hpp gives access to a gnuplot terminal within cpp.  I have included it in 
my project directory, but the program will not execute if gnuplot is not installed.

Upon running it will request a b, n1,n2 to check orthonormality upon. It will output
the result of this calculation for this.  After it will calculate the ground and first 
excited state for the hydrogen and plot just the ground state to the screen.  It will
also save the resulting graphs under gsvariation.ps and excitedvariation.ps.
