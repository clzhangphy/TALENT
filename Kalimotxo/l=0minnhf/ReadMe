This program calculates the ground state of a fictitious l=0 only
neutron drop system.  


hf.cpp
	This is the main body of the program.  
harmonic_oscillator.cpp
	get HO wavefunction from this routine
gauss_legendre.c
	Program used to integrate, ripped from the interenet
functions.cpp
	This program contains only a diagonalization routine
hffunctions.cpp
	This program contains relevent for the hartree-fock routine
minnesota.cpp
	This program contains the matrix elements for minnesota potential
	in a harmonic oscillator.


My program depends on armadillo/lapack/blas gsl libraries.  Also, the header file
gnuplot_i.hpp gives access to a gnuplot terminal within cpp.  I have included it in 
my project directory, but the program will not execute if gnuplot is not installed.

Upon running it will request a b, n1,n2 to check orthonormality upon. It will output
the result of this calculation for this.  After it will calculate the ground and first 
excited state for the hydrogen and plot just the ground state to the screen.  It will
also save the resulting graphs under gsvariation.ps and excitedvariation.ps.
